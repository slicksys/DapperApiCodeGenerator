# DapperApiCodeGenerator
Dapper based complete API  code generation


Start by querying the Information_Schema for your stored procs. The app reads the
data types returned by the procs according to the schema data. The app constructs
the required Interfaces, Dapper Repository Methods, API Controllers and of course
the Entity models themselves.
